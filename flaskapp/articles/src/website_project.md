title: A Comprehensive Guide to Flask Web Development in Python
author: Logan Frederick
date: 2020
keywords: [Python, Flask, Bootstrap]
...

I was inspired to make this guide by three internet personalities.

1. Miguel Grinberg and his excellent, comprehensive [Python Flask tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
2. Luke Smith and his [admonition against internet serfdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKZVIGRAKQ&list=PL-p5XmQHB_JRRnoQyjOfioJdDmu87DIJc)
3. Nat Eliason and his [honest explanation of blogging success](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/start-a-blog)

They say you're the average of the handfull of people you spend the most time
around. It's a one-way relationship, but I could certainly do worse than to
become the average of these three over the course of this long-term project.

I have every intention of making this one article as comprehensive as possible,
referencing all the sources that helped me out along the way. Any number of
people could explain these topics in more depth and with more credibility, so
don't look to me as an authority on best-practice.

My aim here is breadth. And demonstrable employability.
